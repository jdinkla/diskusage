In 2007 when i started with Groovy i wanted to test 
rapid application development (RAD) and the JFreeChart library.

In 2012 i used [gpars](https://github.com/GPars/GPars) to speed up the execution with parallelization.

This tool was developed as a Groovy programming example and to test the chart diagrams
of the JFreeChart library.
